Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nStep 3: Check for divisibility by other prime numbers\\nWe can now check for divisibility by other prime numbers up to the square root of 17077. The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.6, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 130.\\n\\nWe've already checked for divisibility by 2 and 3, so we'll continue with the next prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127.\\n\\nStep 4: Check for divisibility by each prime number\\n17077 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).\\n17077 is not divisible by 7 (17077 ÷ 7 ≈ 2439.57).\\n17077 is not divisible by 11 (17077 ÷ 11 ≈ 1552.45).\\n17077 is not divisible by 13 (17077 ÷ 13 ≈ 1313.62).\\n\\nHowever, when we check for divisibility by 17, we find that 17077 ÷ 17 = 1004.53, which is very close to a whole number. In fact, 17077 ÷ 17 = 1005, with a small error in the previous calculation. So, 17077 is divisible by 17 (17 * 1005 = 17077).\\n\\nSince 17077 has divisors other than 1 and itself (17 and 1005), it is not a prime number.</td>\n",

A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\\n\\nThe first step in determining if a number is prime is to find its square root. The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.68. This is because any factor of 17077 must be less than or equal to its square root. \\n\\nNext, we check if 17077 can be divided evenly by any prime numbers less than 130.68. We start with the smallest prime number, 2, and continue with 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.\\n\\nIf 17077 can be divided evenly (i.e., with no remainder) by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number. If it cannot be divided evenly by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number.\\n\\nLet's start with 2. Since 17077 is an odd number, it cannot be divided evenly by 2. \\n\\nNext, let's try 3. The sum of the digits of 17077 is 1+7+0+7+7=22, which is not divisible by 3, so 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nWe continue this process with the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127. \\n\\nIf 17077 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it is a prime number. However, when we reach 127, we find that 17077 divided by 127 equals 134 with no remainder. \\n\\nTherefore, 17077 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely, 127 and 134).</td>\n",

Check if it's divisible by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. The last digit of 17077 is 7, so it's not divisible by 5.\\n\\n4. Check if it's divisible by 7: There's no simple rule for divisibility by 7. We would have to perform the actual division to check. However, before we do that, there's a more efficient way to check for prime numbers.\\n\\nWe only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.67. So we only need to check divisibility by primes up to 131.\\n\\n5. Check if it's divisible by primes up to 131: This would involve checking divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, and 131. \\n\\nUpon checking, we find that 17077 is divisible by 131 (17077 ÷ 131 = 130).

A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder.\\n\\nStep 1: Check for divisibility by 2\\nSince 17077 is an odd number (it ends in 7), it is not divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 2: Check for divisibility by 3\\nTo check for divisibility by 3, we can add up the digits of the number (1 + 7 + 0 + 7 + 7 = 22) and see if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nStep 3: Check for divisibility by other prime numbers\\nWe can now check for divisibility by other prime numbers up to the square root of 17077. The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.6, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 130.\\n\\nWe've already checked for divisibility by 2 and 3, so we'll continue with the next prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127.\\n\\nStep 4: Check for divisibility by each prime number\\n17077 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).\\n17077 is not divisible by 7 (17077 ÷ 7 ≈ 2439.57).\\n17077 is not divisible by 11 (17077 ÷ 11 ≈ 1552.45).\\n17077 is not divisible by 13 (17077 ÷ 13 ≈ 1313.62).\\n\\nHowever, when we check for divisibility by 17, we find that 17077 ÷ 17 = 1004.53, which is very close to a whole number. In fact, 17077 ÷ 17 = 1005, with a small error in the previous calculation. So, 17077 is divisible by 17 (17 * 1005 = 17077).\\n\\nSince 17077 has divisors other than 1 and itself (17 and 1005), it is not a prime number.   \n",

A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\\n\\nThe first step in determining if a number is prime is to find its square root. The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.68. This is because any factor of 17077 must be less than or equal to its square root. \\n\\nNext, we check if 17077 can be divided evenly by any prime numbers less than 130.68.

If it cannot be divided evenly by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number.\\n\\nLet's start with 2. Since 17077 is an odd number, it cannot be divided evenly by 2. \\n\\nNext, let's try 3. The sum of the digits of 17077 is 1+7+0+7+7=22, which is not divisible by 3, so 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nWe continue this process with the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127. \\n\\nIf 17077 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it is a prime number. However, when we reach 127, we find that 17077 divided by 127 equals 134 with no remainder. \\n\\nTherefore, 17077 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely, 127 and 134).                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

This means that 26 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself (in this case, 2 and 13). \\n\\nTherefore, 26 is not a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
