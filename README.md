Welcome to `prompttools` created by [Hegel AI](https://hegel-ai.com/)! This repo offers a set of free, open-source tools for testing and experimenting with prompts. The core idea is to enable developers to evaluate prompts using familiar interfaces like _code_ and _notebooks_.

In just a few lines of codes, you can test your prompts and parameters across different models (whether you are using
OpenAI, Anthropic, or LLaMA models). You can even evaluate the retrieval accuracy of vector databases.

```python
prompts = ["Tell me a joke.", "Is 17077 a prime number?"]
models = ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4"]
temperatures = [0.0]
openai_experiment = OpenAIChatExperiment(models, prompts, temperature=temperatures)
openai_experiment.run()
openai_experiment.visualize()
```

## Quickstart

To install `prompttools`, you can use `pip`:

```
pip install prompttools
```

You can run a simple example of a `prompttools` locally with the following

```
git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
cd prompttools && jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/OpenAIChatExperiment.ipynb
```

You can also run the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YVcpBew8EqbhXFN8P5NaFrOIqc1FKWeS?usp=sharing)

## Playground

If you want to interact with `prompttools` using our playground interface, you can launch it with the following commands.

First, install prompttools:

```
pip install prompttools
```

Then, clone the git repo and launch the streamlit app:

```
git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
cd prompttools && streamlit run prompttools/playground/playground.py
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. Will this library forward my LLM calls to a server before sending it to OpenAI, Anthropic, and etc.?
    - No, the source code will be executed on your machine. Any call to LLM APIs will be directly executed from your machine without any forwarding.

2. Does `prompttools` store my API keys or LLM inputs and outputs to a server?
    - No, all data stay on your local machine.
